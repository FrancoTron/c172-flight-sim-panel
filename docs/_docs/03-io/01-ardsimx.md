# ArdSimX Interface

I use the excellent [ArdSimX Interface](http://simvim.com/ardsimx.html) to interface with X-Plane.

ArdSimX runs on inexpensive Arduino hardware and makes it simple to interface electrical components with X-Plane.

I am currently using ArdSimX 1.x but I am awaiting the release of ArdSimX.2 to finish wiring up the [avionics stack](/docs/avionics/).

The use of multiplexers in ArdSimX.2 will make it possible to use a common 6-wire bus for the avionics stack allow for [much cleaner, more modular wiring](https://ardsimx.blogspot.com/2017/10/ardsimx2-io-structure.html).

More coming on this..
