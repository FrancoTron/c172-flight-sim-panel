# ArdSimX Interface

I use the excellent [ArdSimX Interface](http://simvim.com/ardsimx.html) to interface with X-Plane.

ArdSimX runs on inexpensive Arduino hardware and makes it simple to interface electrical components with X-Plane.

I plan on upgrading to [SimVimCockpit](http://www.simvim.com/svcockpit.html) (aka ArdSimX 2.0) in the future to take advantage of multiplexers and allow for modular avionics but ArdSimX is working very well for my current needs.
